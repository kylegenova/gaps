This is a fork of Tom Funkhouser's GAPS C++ geometric processing library. It contains modifications in scn2cam to support spline-based trajectories for SUNCG and Matterport.

It adds a dependency on the tinyspline library, which is included (under the MIT license) in the tinyspline/ directory. That dependency should be built first with CMake.
